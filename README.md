The Pixel Matrix
==========================


This is a very rough / dirty prototype for a long-due idea I have been thinking about:

__Use one object - a video, a body, a piece of sound, or anything - to create an environment, a story.__

At 2015 I did the _"Introspection Game"_, trying to create an immersive story in VR using multiple body sensors, the sensor's reading will dictate the story's development, therefore you experience your own body.

This time, the object is a video - streaming from Vimeo. I translated the video's images into a huge mystical thing and put it above the ocean. 

Here is a short screen recording video -> [https://vimeo.com/255467561](https://vimeo.com/255467561)

## Plugin/SDK used:

- Vimeo Unity SDK
- Unity Post Processing Stack v1.0
- Unity Standard Assets ( Character and Environment )


## Things that are left unfinished / TODO / ideas

- The sound of the video didn't get a chance to contribute to the virtual world. Ideas could be - process the sound to an extent it is loosely related to the original but with a new feel - like how this [awesome video](https://vimeo.com/190063150) used Windows 95's starting soundtrack.

- Another usage of the sound of the video could be digitizing the sound and map the numbers to some objects - for example, add force equal to the sound's volume to a tree or an animal - make them move or react to the volume change.
- the material of the cubes are something that can be tweaked around - maybe we can try to use a glass shader for a crystal look?

- There are also a lot of atmospheric stuff we can do with the visual information. I actually calculated an average color of the video, thinking about making the sunlight as the average color, or the fog, or the ambiance color. So the color of the video is reflected in the environment. But I didn't go with that route since I wanted to have a certain aesthetics. But this is a very interesting way to think about the next step.

- Time is extremely limited so I didn't spend enough time picking and processing the sound effect. This is definitely something that can make the surreal ambience stronger.
